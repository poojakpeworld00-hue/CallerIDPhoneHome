/**
 * Keeps every pooled format filled.
 *
 * The pools (interstitial, back interstitial, native, native banner, App Open, rewarded) hold one
 * ad each and used to be filled by the splash alone. A failed preload, a launch with no network,
 * or a session that never went through the splash (the launcher home after a reboot, our icon in
 * our own launcher, the post-call screen) then ran with empty pools for its whole life, and the
 * App Open ad was never reloaded at all.
 *
 * [topUp] asks each pool to fill itself. Each load already skips when its pool holds a fresh ad or
 * a request is in flight, so this costs nothing when everything is full; it is also rate limited.
 * Called when the SDK comes up outside the splash and on every return to the foreground.
