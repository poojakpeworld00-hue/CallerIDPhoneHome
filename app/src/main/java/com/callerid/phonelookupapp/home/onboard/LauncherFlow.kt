 *
 * The sequence itself comes from Remote Config — `launcher_ads.onboarding.order` — and
 * defaults to:
 *
 *     Splash
 *       └─ Set as default launcher?   (opens the system home-app page on arrival)
 *            ├─ allowed  → Home        (with skip_rest_on_grant, the default)
 *            └─ skipped  → Language → Welcome (notifications + phone state) → Intro → Home
 *
 * Reorder it, drop a screen, or list `set_default` twice to ask again at the end; see
 * `docs/launcher-ads-config.md`. "Home" is [homeActivity]: the launcher module's [LauncherPanel] by
 * default, or the caller-ID app's own [AppCoreActivity] when `onboarding_home` is `"app"`.
 *
 * How far the sequence has got is kept in fossify's shared prefs (`onboarding_step`), an index into the resolved
 * order. A cold start that finds onboarding unfinished restarts it from the top, exactly as
 * the hardcoded flow did.
